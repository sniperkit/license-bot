🐙🤖 A Github bot to help with Open-Source license conformence

We love MPL-2.0, Open-Source software and our Developers.

But with the ever increasing use of OSS, we as a community can forget to license our software.
This lil' bot, will scan your repo's and make the approporate PR's so that your project conforms to a desired license.
For YLD, that is MPL-2.0.
